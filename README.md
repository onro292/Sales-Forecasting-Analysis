# Sales-Forecasting-Analysis
Analyzed store sales data using Python, forecasted sales in R, built sales dashboard in tableau

# Project Work Flow
The project is divided up into 3 parts:
1. Data is first loaded into Python for pre-processing. The .ipynb file contains the jupyter notebook. Unfortunately, some dynamic graphs do not work on github.
2. Then the data is loaded into R for forecasting and time series analysis. The .rmd file shows all the code and text to generate the rmarkdown file. The pdf is the finished rmarkdown report. The pdf contains no R code and only shows the code output (graphs and forecasting numbers) in a clean format.
3. A sales dashboard is made in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesDashboard_16123396275650/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link
